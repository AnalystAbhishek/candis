### Known Issues
* Dialog requires double-click to be shown *(Issues with Bootstrap Modal)*.
* ReactDataGrid does not fit columns to parent when component is hidden (within a hidden Modal).
* bootstrap-selectpicker does not integrate well with ReactJS + Redux state changes (requires a `$('.selectpicker').selectpicker('render')` after every state update.)
